## Backlog

### Phase 999.1: Windows Cross-Platform Compatibility Fixes (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Fix platform-specific code that prevents Windows usage. Critical: `engine/shell.rs` hardcodes `sh -c` (needs `cmd /C` on Windows). Medium: `SettingsPage.tsx` shortcut only checks `metaKey` (needs `ctrlKey` fallback), `filesystem.rs` uses `/dev/null` (needs `NUL` on Windows). Low: several test files use Unix-specific paths/commands needing conditional compilation.
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd:review-backlog when ready)

### Phase 999.2: Wire Calendar Events to Smart Scheduler and OAuth Setup (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Close two v1.0 tech debt items: (1) `scheduling_commands.rs:94-97` passes an empty `Vec<CalendarEvent>` to `find_open_blocks` -- replace with a query against `calendar_events` table so meetings are factored into scheduling. (2) Add runtime guard in `connect_google_calendar`/`connect_outlook_calendar` that detects placeholder OAuth client IDs and returns an actionable error, plus create `.env.example` and setup docs for registering Google/Microsoft OAuth apps.
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd:review-backlog when ready)

### Phase 999.3: Plugin Skills and MCP Server Support (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Extend the plugin system so plugins can expose skills (slash-command-like capabilities) and register MCP server connections, similar to Claude Code's skill/MCP architecture. Plugins would declare skills in their manifest that appear in the workflow step picker and UI command palette. MCP server plugins would provide tool access for AI-assisted task execution -- the AI gateway routes tool calls to the appropriate MCP server based on plugin registration.
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd:review-backlog when ready)

### Phase 999.4: GSD .planning/ Directory Sync (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** When a directory is linked to a project, scan for `.planning/ROADMAP.md` and parse existing phases/tasks into the Element database. File watcher on `.planning/` syncs updates as GSD executes phases (e.g., SUMMARY.md created → mark tasks complete). This would let users run `/gsd:new-project` in a linked directory and see the resulting phases and tasks visualized in the app.
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd:review-backlog when ready)

### Phase 999.5: Vision-Driven Goal Planning and Covey Role Management (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Add workspace-level vision statements, SMART goals (own table), Covey 7-Habits role-based theme management, and a reconciliation layer between active work and stated goals. Helps users define where they want to be, back into themes/projects/phases/tasks, and surface when daily work drifts from what matters. Self-discovery dimension. Could be separate feature area from project management with reconciliation between the two.
